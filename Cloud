2. **Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel, making them faster and more lightweight than virtual machines.
3. **Reproducibility**: Developers can ensure the same app setup in development, testing, and production.
4. **Scalability**: Easily scale applications up or down by running multiple containers.

---

### 🔹 Key Concepts in Docker

| Term            | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Docker Container** | A lightweight, isolated environment that includes the app and all its dependencies. |
| **Docker Image**     | A read-only template used to create containers. It includes the application code, runtime, libraries, etc. |
| **Dockerfile**       | A text file with instructions to build a Docker image. |
| **Docker Hub**       | A cloud-based repository to share and download Docker images. |
| **Docker Engine**    | The core of Docker that manages images, containers, and other components. |

---

### 🔹 Docker Architecture

Docker follows a **Client-Server architecture**:

- **Client**: Users interact with Docker using command-line tools (CLI).
- **Docker Daemon (Server)**: Runs in the background and handles building, running, and distributing containers.
- **REST API**: Allows communication between client and daemon.

---

### 🔹 Components of Docker Engine

1. **Server (Docker Daemon)**: Builds and manages containers.
2. **REST API**: Communicates between client and server.
3. **Client (CLI)**: Allows users to run Docker commands like `docker run`, `docker stop`, etc.

---

### 🔹 Common Docker Commands

| Command         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `docker run`   | Starts a new container from an image. |
| `docker pull`  | Downloads an image from Docker Hub. |
| `docker ps`    | Lists running containers. |
| `docker stop`  | Stops a running container. |
| `docker start` | Restarts a stopped container. |
| `docker login` | Logs into Docker Hub (for private images). |

---

### 🔹 Real-Life Analogy

- Think of a **Docker image** as a **recipe**.
- A **container** is like the **dish** prepared using that recipe.
- You can run the same image on any system and get the same result — just like following the same recipe gives the same dish, no matter where you cook it.

---

### 🔹 Summary

Docker is a modern containerization tool that makes application development, testing, and deployment **fast, consistent, and efficient**. Its lightweight containers allow you to run multiple apps on the same system without conflicts, making it an essential tool for DevOps and cloud environments.

Kubernetes follows a **Client-Server (Master-Slave)** architecture and runs in the form of a **Kubernetes cluster**, which includes:

| Component         | Role |
|------------------|------|
| **Master Node**   | Controls the cluster and manages worker nodes. |
| **Worker Nodes**  | Run the actual applications (containers/pods). |

Each cluster includes:

- At least **one Master Node**
- One or more **Worker Nodes**

---

### 🔹 Key Kubernetes Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **kube-apiserver** | The entry point to the Kubernetes control plane. It handles all REST API calls and communicates with the cluster. |
| **kube-controller-manager** | Watches the cluster state and makes changes to maintain desired state (e.g., auto-scaling, handling node failures). |
| **kube-scheduler** | Assigns new Pods to appropriate nodes based on resource availability. |
| **kubelet** | Runs on each worker node; it receives instructions from the master to create, start, or delete containers. |
| **kube-proxy** | Manages networking rules so that services can be accessed inside and outside the cluster. |
| **kubectl** | CLI tool to communicate with Kubernetes clusters (e.g., `kubectl apply`, `kubectl get pods`). |

---

### 🔹 Kubernetes Objects and Terms

| Term       | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Pod**         | The smallest unit in Kubernetes that contains one or more containers. |
| **Service**     | A way to expose a pod or a group of pods to the network. |
| **Deployment**  | Manages a group of pods and ensures the desired number of replicas are running. |
| **Namespace**   | Logical partitions to manage multiple applications in the same cluster. |

---

### 🔹 Step-by-Step: Deploying an App on Kubernetes

#### ✅ Step 1: Setup Kubernetes Cluster
- Install Kubernetes using tools like **Minikube**, **kubeadm**, or use cloud providers (e.g., Google Kubernetes Engine, AWS EKS, Azure AKS).
- A cluster should have **1 Master node** and at least **2 Worker nodes**.

#### ✅ Step 2: Create a Deployment Manifest File
- Write a YAML file specifying:
  - Number of Pods
  - Container image (e.g., nginx)
  - Resources (CPU/RAM)
- Use `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` to create deployment.

#### ✅ Step 3: Expose the App via a Service
- Write another manifest for the service:
  - Define **type** (e.g., LoadBalancer, NodePort, ClusterIP)
  - Set **ports** and **selectors**
- Use `kubectl apply -f service.yaml` to expose your app to users.

---

### 🔹 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine running a **restaurant**:
- Docker containers are like **individual chefs**, each cooking a dish.
- Kubernetes is like the **manager** who assigns tasks to chefs, makes sure food is prepared on time, replaces sick chefs, and adds more if demand increases.

---

### 🔹 Summary

Kubernetes is a **powerful and flexible tool** for managing modern, scalable applications in **containers**. It helps you deploy, manage, monitor, and scale apps automatically, making it a **backbone for DevOps, microservices, and cloud-native development**.

- CSP handles:
  - Server provisioning
  - Scaling (up/down automatically)
  - Security updates
  - Load balancing
- **You only pay for what you use** — compute time is billed based on execution.

---

### 🧩 **Main Components of a Serverless Architecture**

1. **API Gateway**
   - Connects client apps with backend functions.
   - Uses HTTPS to handle requests and route them to serverless functions.

2. **Function as a Service (FaaS)**
   - Executes individual code functions (e.g., AWS Lambda).
   - Each function runs in response to a specific event.

3. **Backend as a Service (BaaS)**
   - Ready-made backend services like databases, authentication, storage.
   - Removes the need to manage backend infrastructure.

4. **Client Interface**
   - The web or mobile app users interact with.
   - Triggers functions through APIs based on user actions.

5. **Security Services**
